# Python-GUI-Games

This repository contains various interactive Python GUI games/programs involving interesting algorithms. Currently, the repository has the following games/programs:
* [Minimax Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/RandomY-2/Python-GUI-Games/tree/main/TicTacToe):
  * A Tic-Tac-Toe game created using Python's Tkinter interface. 
  * The user can play against the computer which is programmed using minimax algorithm and will think recursively to take the best move. 
* [A* Shortest Path Finding Visualization](https://github.com/RandomY-2/Python-GUI-Games/tree/main/A_Star_Visualization)
  * An A* Shortest Path Finding algorithm visualization created using the Pygame modules.
  * The user can create the start and end points and barriers and see how A* path finding algorithm will determine the shortest path between start and end points
