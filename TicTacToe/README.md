## Minimax Tic Tac Toe 

## Description 
This game is created using Tkinder interface and the minimax algorithm. Once the user compiles and runs the python file, a GUI with the tic tac toe board will be displayed
and the user can play Tic Tac Toe with the computer. The user will go first and use X, and the computer will use O. Once the result is determined, a dialog will pop up to 
tell the user which side had win or if there is a tie. If user tries to move X on an invalid location(where the user or the computer has already occupied), a warning dialog 
will also pop up, forbidding the user from further playing. 

## Minimax Algorithm
Minimax is a recursive backtracking algorithm that is used in game theory to find the most optimal move. The algorithm assumes that the opponent always plays most optimally, 
and the algorithm will find what action leads to the best outcome in this sense. For this game, the minimax algorithm is implemented so that the program will play the move that
can lead to best game result (win > tie > lose).
